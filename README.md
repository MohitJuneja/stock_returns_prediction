# Project Predictive Modeling: MVP
### Predicting future stock price returns. *(a Kaggle competition from sigma2)*

## Introduction

Can we actually predict stock prices with Machine Learning? 

Investors make educated guesses by analyzing data. They'll read the news, study the company history, industry, trends...  There are lots of data points that go into malking a predction. 
The prevailing theory is that stock prices are totally random and unpredicatble. A blind-folded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper's financial pages could select a protfolio that could do just as well as one carefully selected by experts. 

But that raises the question, why do top firms like Morgan Stanley and citigroup hire quantitative analysts to go build predictive models. We have this idea of a trading floor filled with adrenalined-infused men, with loose ties, running around, yelling something into a phone. But these days are more likely to see rows of ML experts quietly sitting in front of computer screens in fact about 70% of all orders on Wall street are now placed by software. 

We are now living in the age of algorithms. 

## Question: 

This kaggle competition aims to predict stock price performance by extracting features from pieces of news. 

## Datasets

This competition is only supported using the Kaggle kernel environment (i.e., we cannot use our PC notebook or other IDE environment). 
Kaggle provides 2 csv files, one with all the necessary market data and the other with the necessary news information.

## Algorithm
1. Data Acquisition
2. Preprocessing
    - Prep the news dataframe by expanding the data for every assetCode. 
    - The news info needs to be grouped by the day determined by the market column called *'time'*. 
        - Since merging is based in time: From yesterday at 22h01 til today at 22h
    - Merge news and market dataframes (by assetCode and time): At this point 
3. Training: 
    The training data given is controled by time. 
2. Testing
    - market_obs_df, news_obs_df, predictions_template_df
    - For every assetCode in the predictions_template_df test your model to get the confidence interval. 
    - The validation process involves 628 iterations. For every iteration it is given a market data for a day D and news informations starting at 10:01pm on the previous day til day D at 10pm. 

## Preprocessing
### MARKET
#### Feature Selection

To recall I'm going to model the prediction of the variable for each asset code.  
There are a few assetCodes pertaining to the same asset, because of this reason and the fact there are assets whose name is unknown and yet they have valid unique asset codes, that I will keep the asset codes and get rid of the asset names. 


Some Missing Values and their %: 
    - returnsClosePrevMktres1	0.392344
    - returnsOpenPrevMktres1	0.392540
    - returnsClosePrevMktres10	2.283599
    - returnsOpenPrevMktres10	2.284680
In other words I cannot count with the residualized open-to-open and close-to-close for one day and 10 days. Since they show a high correaltion with their homologue raw features unless they show an improvement to the classifier's performance they will be added as an upgrade. 

As for the news info, there are pieces of news that refer to 1 or more asset codes, therefore Im going to transform the news table so that it will be indexed by a single and unique asset code. This means that the number of rows will increase adding more redundancy to the training dataset. (Can this be avoided?)
Furthermore I'm leaving out of the feature selection: the headline, take sequence, provider, headlinetag and assetName since at first glance they are not fit to relate with the stock change. 


#### Normalization

I will use the log transform to normalize these highly skewed features. Since they can have negative values the process will start with a translation by a constant then the transformation by the log.


#### Vectorization

Since Im using features in both tables it's easier to merge them. It's important to consider that the Market table has the target variable called *returnsOpenNextMktres10* with a domain in the natural numbers. The key in common between the tables is the assetCode. But first a small manip needs to be performed unto the news table since every row can contain 1 or more asset codes. 

#### Feature Engineering

- Time features: 
    - time(datetime64[ns, UTC]) - UTC timestamp showing when the data was available on the feed (second precision)
    - sourceTimestamp(datetime64[ns, UTC]) - UTC timestamp of this news item when it was created
    - firstCreated(datetime64[ns, UTC]) - UTC timestamp for the first version of the item

In other words: *time >= sourceTimestamp >= firstCreated*  
***Are these time features statistically significant to consider each one of them?*** If so they can be feature-engineered by their time-difference from the news piece's origin (firstCreated). 

- t-statistic for the time features
- There are 1631 unique subjects and every asset has in average 20. 
- There are 191 unique audiences and every asset has an average of 5.

## Results Submission

Logit regressors are commonly used to estimate the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class. So the prediction can be made by classifying on whether a stock will rise or sink.
